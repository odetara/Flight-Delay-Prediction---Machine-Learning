# Flight-Delay-Prediction---Machine-Learning

**Introduction:**

The aviation industry plays a crucial role in modern transportation, connecting people and goods across the globe. However, flight delays have become a very important subject for air transportation all over the world because of the associated financial losses that the aviation industry is continuously going through.
Delays caused inconvenience to airlines and passengers. Financial losses and increased stress
Is it possible to predict when a flight will be delayed even before it comes out on the departure board?

**Scope**

The scope of this project is to understand historical flight data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors to build a robust prediction model. The project will offer real-time predictions, empowering airlines and passengers to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of potential delays.

**Objectives**

The aim of the project is to build advanced machine learning models that analyze historical flight data and relevant factors(e.g., weather conditions, air traffic) to predict flight delays with a high level of accuracy, enhance operational efficiency, and improve passenger experience.

**Key Insights:**

The models demonstrated high accuracy across the board, with Decision Tree achieving an impressive accuracy of 94%. XGBClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier both exhibited 94% accuracy, showcasing their robust predictive capabilities. Random Forest also performed well, with an accuracy of 91%.

The decision tree and XGB classifier have the highest true positive and true negative counts, indicating strong predictive capabilities.

Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Classifier show a higher rate of false negatives, suggesting room for improvement in capturing instances of flight delays.

Random Forest strikes a balance between precision and recall, with relatively low false positive and false negative counts.
Similar interpretations can be made for the confusion matrices of other models. Aiming to minimize false positives and false negatives is crucial, and the choice of a specific model depends on the balance needed between precision and recall, considering the specific goals and constraints of the application.

The R-squared value indicates that the model captures a moderate portion of the variability in flight delay times, but there is room for improvement.
The MAE and MSE values suggest a moderate level of accuracy in predicting flight delay times, with deviations around 0.17996 units on average.
The RMSE provides a sense of the average magnitude of errors and is larger than the MAE, indicating that larger errors contribute more to the overall prediction error.

**Recommendations:**

1. Implement predictive maintenance.
2. Optimize Scheduling
3. Invest in advanced weather prediction.
4. Continuous Model Improvement

In conclusion, leveraging machine learning for flight delay prediction can significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of air travel, benefiting both airlines and passengers alike.
